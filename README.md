# Generative AI using LangChain
**LangChain** is an open-source framework designed to simplify and streamline the creation of applications using large language models (LLMs). It serves as a middleware that helps developers go beyond basic prompt-based applications to build sophisticated, context-aware and production-ready generative AI systems.
